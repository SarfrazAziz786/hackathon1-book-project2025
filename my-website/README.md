# Spec-Driven Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Spec-Driven Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics with Embedded RAG Chatbot. This book is designed to provide comprehensive coverage of:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Understanding ROS 2 as the middleware layer connecting AI agents to humanoid robot hardware and simulators.
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Building digital twins for humanoid robots using simulation.
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - Using NVIDIA Isaac technologies to build the AI "brain" of humanoid robots.
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Integrating vision, language, and action for humanoid robot autonomy.
