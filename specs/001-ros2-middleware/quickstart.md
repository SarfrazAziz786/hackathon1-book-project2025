# Quickstart Guide: ROS 2 Middleware Educational Module

## Getting Started

This guide will help you set up and navigate the ROS 2 Middleware Educational Module, designed for AI and robotics students with basic Python knowledge.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Interest in robotics concepts
- Web browser to access the documentation

## Accessing the Module

The ROS 2 Middleware Educational Module is structured in three chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals**
   - Learn about nodes, topics, and services
   - Understand the ROS 2 communication model
   - Explore practical examples of ROS 2 concepts

2. **Chapter 2: Bridging AI Agents to Robots**
   - Discover how Python agents use rclpy to control robots
   - Understand control flow from software to actuators
   - Work with practical Python examples

3. **Chapter 3: Robot Description with URDF**
   - Learn about structure, joints, and links
   - Understand humanoid robot modeling
   - Explore URDF examples

## Learning Path

1. Start with Chapter 1 if you're new to ROS 2
2. Progress through the chapters sequentially for best understanding
3. Complete the exercises and examples in each chapter
4. Refer to the official ROS 2 documentation for additional details

## Technical Implementation

If you want to run the code examples locally:

1. Install ROS 2 (Iron Irwini or later recommended)
2. Set up your Python environment
3. Create a ROS 2 workspace
4. Run the example code provided in each chapter

## Checking Your Understanding

Each chapter includes:
- Key concepts summaries
- Practical examples
- Self-assessment questions
- Links to related topics in the ROS 2 documentation

## Going Further

After completing this module, you should be able to:
- Explain ROS 2 middleware and communication model
- Describe nodes, topics, and services with practical context
- Understand how Python agents use rclpy to control robots
- Explain the role of URDF in humanoid robot structure
